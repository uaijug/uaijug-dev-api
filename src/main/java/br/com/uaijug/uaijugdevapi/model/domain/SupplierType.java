    /*Services. These include suppliers of electricity, water, telephones, IT, email, website hosting, stationery, facilities, transport, etc.

        Sub-contractors. If you’re in a trade business, these will include other tradespeople. If you’re a consultant, training provider, etc, these will include other consultants, trainers, etc. You might contract these people direct or through an agency.

        Manufacturers/producers. For some types of business it’s possible to buy products or components direct from the earliest point of the supply chain – the manufacturer. This is normally the least expensive option, as the items won’t have been marked-up by other parts of the chain. However, sometimes manufactures have a minimum order size, which can be too high for many smaller businesses. If you’ve invented a product you’ll need to find a manufacturer.

        Distributors. Brokers and wholesalers buy large quantities from a range of manufacturers. Although they mark-up the prices, distributors can supply smaller orders that manufacturers may refuse.  Distributors can also supply items from different manufacturers.

        Importers. They act like a domestic distributor, only the items they buy are from overseas. In some countries, because of the way supply chains work, it can be difficult, even for importers, to buy direct from manufacturers – they may have buy from wholesalers in those countries.
